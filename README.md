## Notes
  - Assets such as images are placed in the `public` folder, and are automatically compiled and understood by Ember.

## Part 2 
Learning how to:
- Define Routes
- Customize URLs
- Link Pages with `<LinkTo>` component
- Passing arguments and attributes to components

Everytime we generate a new route, we do the following:
1. Map the route in Router.js
2. Create a template for the Route. (Templates are the 'view')
3. [OPTIONAL] Define an explicit path for errors or custom URLs
